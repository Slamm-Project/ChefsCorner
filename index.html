                  <li>160 g ripe mixed-colour cherry tomatoes</li>
                  <li>1 small ripe mango</li>
                  <li>¬Ω a small ripe avocado</li>
                  <li>2 spring onions</li>
                  <li>2 x 130 g salmon fillets , skin on, scaled, pin-boned, from sustainable sources</li>
                  <li>2 heaped teaspoons Cajun seasoning</li>
                  <li>4 small tortillas</li>
                  <li>2 limes</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <p>
                  Quarter the cherry tomatoes. Destone, peel and roughly chop the mango. Scoop out the avocado and finely slice. Trim and finely slice the spring onions. Carefully cut the skin off the salmon and place it in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat to crisp up on both sides. Pat the Cajun seasoning all over the salmon fillets, then fry for 5 minutes, turning to get them golden on each of their sides. Once the skin is crispy, move it to sit on top of the salmon. <br>
                  <br>
                  Meanwhile, use tongs to toast the tortillas directly over the flame of your gas hob for 15 seconds, or use a hot pan. Sprinkle the mango, avocado and spring onions over the tortillas, then flake over the salmon and crack over the skin. Toss the tomatoes and the juice of 1 lime in the residual heat of the pan for 30 seconds, then spoon over the tortillas. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.

                  <li>400 g mixed seasonal salad veg, such as cucumber, red cabbage, apples, cress, baby spinach</li>
                  <li>olive oil</li>

                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Creamy Basil Dressing</span><br>
                  <li>4 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
                  <li>tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
                  <li>4 sprigs of fresh basil</li>
                  <li>¬º of a fresh red chilli</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>Wrap the tofu in a clean tea towel, then squeeze and wring it out to remove the excess liquid (about 4 tablespoons should come out ‚Äì it‚Äôs messy, but really important to do this for great burger texture later).</li>
                  <li>Place the tofu in a bowl, scraping it off the tea towel. Crack in the egg, then add the breadcrumbs and Marmite. Mix and scrunch together really well with clean hands, then shape into 4 even-sized patties that‚Äôll fit nicely in your buns once cooked.
                  <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes and put into a dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat with a pinch of black pepper, a splash of water and the vinegar.</li>
                  <li>Squash the tomatoes with a potato masher, cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thick and delicious, then tear in the basil leaves and season to perfection (I sometimes add a pinch of dried red chilli flakes too, for a kick).</li>
                  <li>If you want to plump up your buns, pop them into a warm oven for a few minutes.</li>
                  <li>Meanwhile, finely slice or prep all the salad veg.</li>
                  <li>Next, pick the basil leaves into a blender and blitz with all the other dressing ingredients and a pinch of salt and pepper until super-smooth.</li>
                  <li>Place 2 teaspoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves into the pan in four piles, place the patties on top and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden.</li>
                  <li>Slice or grate the cheese, place on the patties, reduce the heat to low, then cover and leave to melt for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Spread the tomato sauce into the buns, then sandwich the cheesy burgers and sliced gherkins inside.</li>
                  <li>Toss the salad with half the dressing (save the rest for another day), serve alongside the burgers and enjoy ‚Äì totally awesome.</li>

                  <li>Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, toss to coat and put aside.</li>
                  <li>Crack the egg into a blender, add the flour, milk, remaining spinach and a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until smooth.</li>
                  <li>Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, rub the pan with a little olive oil, then pour in a thin layer of batter, swirling it up and around the edges. Cook on one side only for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then stack up on a serving plate and repeat.</li>
                  <li>Top each pancake with dollops of cottage cheese, the avocado salad, and a few good shakes of chilli sauce. Really nice served with extra lime wedges for squeezing over, and a fried egg on top, if you fancy.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Put a large pan on a medium-high heat, and toast the bread as the pan heats up, turning when golden.</li>
                  <li>Trim and finely slice the courgettes, and halve the cherry tomatoes.</li>
                  <li>Check the mussels ‚Äì if any are open, just give them a little tap and they should close; if they don‚Äôt they‚Äôre no good, so chuck those ones away.</li>
                  <li>Remove the toast and spread one quarter of the pesto on each slice. You can find a recipe for my Super-quick batch pesto, if you'd like to have a go at making your own.</li>
                  <li>Turn the heat under the pan up to full whack and tip in the mussels. Stir in the remaining pesto, the courgettes, tomatoes and peas.</li>
                  <li>Add the wine (if using), or a good splash of water. Cover with a lid and leave to steam for 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.</li>
                  <li>When all the mussels have opened and are soft and juicy, they‚Äôre ready. If any remain closed, simply throw those away. Divide the mussels, veg and all those gorgeous juices between two large bowls, pick over the basil leaves and serve with the pesto toasts on the side for some epic dunking.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>As kids love pasta and tomato sauce, this is an easy way to encourage them to try asparagus. Like the ‚Äòfull of veg‚Äô tomato sauce you can always whiz the asparagus in a blender if you think they‚Äôll be suspicious of the green bits.</li>
                  <li>The tomato does a good job of mellowing the flavour of the asparagus and once they‚Äôre used to eating it there are loads of wonderful dishes you can introduce them to.</li>
                  <li>Heat a saucepan over a medium heat and add a nice lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and fry until it turns a light golden brown. Add the chopped basil stalks and tinned tomatoes, and bring to the boil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt, then simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Snap the woody ends off the asparagus stalks and throw them away. You can either chop the asparagus finely with a knife or use a food processor. Add it to the tomato sauce, let it simmer for 1 minute or so, then take it off the heat. Taste, and add a little salt and pepper if needed. Finish off the sauce by stirring in the basil leaves.</li>
                  <li>Cook the tagliatelle according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Toss in the pasta sauce with a little of the water to loosen. Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and plenty of Parmesan cheese.</li>

                  <li>Heat the oil in a small, heavy-based pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the shallots and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a tray lined with kitchen paper.</li>
                  <li>Combine the noodles with the remaining dressing, baby spinach, spring onion, broad beans and herbs. Top with the chicken and garnish with the shallots.</li>

                  <li>Halve the chillies (deseed if you like), peel and finely slice the onions, then peel and crush the garlic. Quarter the plum tomatoes, and pick the coriander leaves.
                  <li>Rub the chicken legs all over with a drizzle of oil and the garam masala, then transfer to a large non-stick ovenproof pan.
                  <li>Add another drizzle of oil and fry the chicken over a medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lovely and dark golden all over. Be brave and let it get really nice and dark ‚Äì it will make such a difference to the end result if you get it right at this stage. Drain off any excess fat.
                  <li>At this point, preheat the oven to 180¬∫C/350¬∫F/gas 4.
                  <li>Next, add the curry leaves, mustard seeds, chillies, onion and garlic to the chicken. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, then add the tomatoes and white wine vinegar.
                  <li>Transfer the pan to the oven. Cook, uncovered, for 50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and falling off the bone.
                  <li>Pop the pan on the hob and reduce the liquid until sticky. Scatter with the coriander leaves and serve with the cooling yoghurt. Delicious with rice or couscous, and a crisp, refreshing salad.

                  <li>Turn on the oven to 200¬∫C/gas 6. Carefully cut the pastry block in half with a table knife. Wrap the other half and refrigerate or freeze for later.</li>
                  <li>Dust some flour onto a clean work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll out the pastry into a square, measuring 26cm x 26cm. Cut into 4 equal squares.</li>

                  <li>Squash the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl, then snap the asparagus spears into 3cm pieces. Keep the lovely pointy tips and a little of the stalk, but discard the end 3cm.</li>
                  <li>Using a speed peeler, carefully shred the courgettes into ribbons. Tear the roasted peppers into strips and add to the bowl.</li>
                  <li>Pick the basil leaves, reserving the pretty ones for later. Place the large ones in the mixing bowl.</li>
                  <li>Mix the vegetables together in the bowl, adding a splash of oil. Pile a little of the mixture on each pesto-smeared tart and top with two olives (if using).</li>
                  <li>Break up the mozzarella and place little bits on top of each tart ‚Äì this will make it gooey like a pizza. Grate over some Parmesan (if using).</li>
                  <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the cheese is all bubbly.</li>

                  <li>Pasta‚Äôs a popular choice for children as it‚Äôs a fun food: it comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and is easy to eat. It‚Äôs a good staple for older kids to learn how to cook, as they can pair it with any flavours they like, or vegetables that are in season. We think kids will like the way the asparagus and courgettes are peeled to resemble the pasta ribbons (we do too). Peeling is a useful skill that even little children can learn, while older children can master cooking and assembling. You could make your own pasta if you have a machine ‚Äì it‚Äôs a fun activity for everyone to get involved in.</li>
                  <li>Fill a large saucepan with water, add a big pinch of sea salt and bring it to the boil.</li>
                  <li>Peel the vegetables into ribbons with a speed peeler. Set aside.</li>
                  <li>Break the eggs into a big mixing bowl, add the cr√®me fra√Æche and Parmesan cheese, and finely grate in the lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper, then mix well.</li>
                  <li>Cook the pasta in the large pan of boiling water according to the packet directions.</li>
                  <li>Heat a glug of oil in a large pan. Chop and add the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes, until crisp.</li>
                  <li>Setting aside a cupful of water, drain the pasta.</li>
                  <li>Off the heat, add the pasta to the pancetta, pick in most of the mint, then add the veg ribbons, egg mixture and a splash of pasta water.</li>
                  <li>Stir it all together, then add more pasta water if you think it needs it.</li>
                  <li>Dish it up, then top each bowl with the remaining mint leaves and an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>

                  <li>For the salsa, put a fine-to-coarse grater over a chopping board and grate your tomatoes to a slurry. You‚Äôll end up with seeds and skin on one side, slurry on the other ‚Äì get rid of the seeds and skin.</li>
                  <li>Grate in the chilli and season well. Add a lug of oil, a swig of vinegar and stir in some chopped fresh herbs, if you have any.</li>
                  <li>Twist off the lobster tails, then cut into 2cm slices (use the rivets of the tail as guides). Leave the shell on to protect the meat as it cooks and help keep its shape.</li>
                  <li>Toss the chunks in oil, sea salt, black pepper and mustard, then barbecue for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until cooked. Peel.</li>
                  <li>Barbecue the bacon, turning after a couple of minutes, till golden and crispy.</li>
                  <li>Halve and toast the buns at the same time, then lay the bottom halves on a nice board. Halve the garlic and rub the cut side over each one.</li>
                  <li>Drizzle with oil, then add a tiny blob of ketchup, 1 teaspoon of mayo and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
                  <li>Click off the lettuce leaves and place one onto each bun with a nice wodge of watercress. Top with the lobster and salsa, and crumble over the bacon.</li>
                  <li>Peel, finely slice and scatter over some red onion, and top with the bun lid. Secure the burgers with skewers, then serve.

                  <li>hoisin sauce , to serve</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>To make the filling, peel and finely slice the garlic and ginger. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. Heat a splash of groundnut oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the garlic, ginger and coriander stalks.  Fry for around 3 minutes, or until golden. Slice the mushrooms, then add to the pan for around 5 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.</li>
                  <li>Add the vinegar, chilli sauce and soy, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the liquid has boiled and bubbled away and the mushrooms are golden brown and starting to caramelise. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
                  <li>Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add the white part to the bowl. Deseed and finely slice the chilli, then add half to the bowl, reserving the rest for later. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, then set aside.</li>
                  <li>Add the coconut milk, 2 heaped tins‚Äô worth of flour and a good pinch of sea salt to a food processor. Whiz to a dough, then transfer to a flour-dusted surface and roll into a thick sausage. Cut into 12 equal-sized pieces, roll into balls, then flatten into rounds, roughly ¬Ωcm thick.</li>
                  <li>Equally divide the mushroom mixture between each of the 12 dough circles (you'll need roughly 1 tablespoon of filling per circle), making sure to leave a 2cm gap around the edges. Pull and fold the sides over the filling, pinching the edges together to seal. Place upside-down (so the scruffy edges are underneath) in double-layered, lightly greased muffin cases and divide between two bamboo steamer baskets.</li>
                  <li>Place a wok over a high heat, then fill with 1 litre of boiling water and pop the steamer baskets on top. Reduce the heat to medium and steam for around 12 minutes, or until piping hot through and puffed up.</li>
                  <li>Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Once the buns are ready, sprinkle over the seeds and the reserved spring onions and chilli. Tear the coriander leaves on top, then serve with hoisin sauce for dipping.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>For the raspberry curd, tip the berries into a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of the sugar, 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and a little splash of water.</li>
                  <li>Cook over a low heat for about 5 minutes, until the fruit is very soft, then push it through a fine mesh or sieve into a heatproof bowl.
                  <li>Mix the remaining sugar into the raspberries, then add the butter and sit the bowl over a pan of simmering water.</li>
                  <li>Stir for about 2 minutes, or until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved.</li>
                  <li>In a separate bowl, beat together the egg, yolks and vanilla bean paste, whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons of the warm raspberry mixture to loosen, then mix it into the remaining raspberry in the bowl.</li>
                  <li>Cook the curd over the simmering water for about 10 minutes, until thickened and it coats the back of a spoon, stirring often.</li>
                  <li>Strain the mixture into a clean bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm (to stop a skin forming) and set aside to cool.</li>
                  <li>For the choux, preheat the oven to 180¬∫C/gas 4.</li>
                  <li>Dice and add butter to a pan with the milk and 75ml of water.it over a low heat until the butter has melted, then increase the heat to bring the mixture to a rolling boil.</li>
                  <li>Remove the pan from the hob (turn down the heat to low). Sift and beat in the flour, along with the sugar and a pinch of sea salt.</li>
                  <li>Keep beating until the mixture is smooth, glossy and comes away from the sides of the pan.</li>
                  <li>Flash the pan on the hob for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly, to dry out the mixture a little. Take it off the heat, tip the mixture into a clean bowl and leave it to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Beat the eggs, then gradually add them to the choux mixture, mixing well between each addition. You may not need all of the egg ‚Äì just enough so the mixture drops reluctantly from the spoon.
                  <li>Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper, then drop rounded teaspoonfuls of the choux batter onto it, leaving space between each to allow for expansion.</li>
                  <li>Bake them on the middle shelf of the oven for about 20 minutes, or until golden and doubled in size.</li>
                  <li>Pierce the bottom of each bun with a skewer to release the steam and return them to the oven for a further 2 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                  <li>In a bowl, whip the double cream and Greek yoghurt until it holds firm peaks, then fold in the raspberry curd until it holds soft peaks ‚Äì don‚Äôt over-fold as this will make it hard to pipe into the buns.</li>
                  <li>Scoop the filling into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle. Cut a small hole underneath each choux bun and fill with the raspberry cream.</li>
                  <li>To make the glaze, scoop the passion fruit pulp into a sieve set over a bowl, pushing as much juice though as you can.</li>
                  <li>Whisk the fondant icing sugar into the juice until smooth and the icing holds a ribbon trail.</li>
                  <li>Carefully spoon the passion fruit icing over each bun and leave to set for 5 minutes before topping with a fresh raspberry and a few rose or raspberry sprinkles, if you like.</li>

                  <li>3 tablespoons dark rum</li>
                  <li>50 g good-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids)</li>
                  <li>50 g hazelnuts</li>
                  <li>4 tablespoons dulce de leche</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>The night before, place a shallow dish and 6 dessert or sundae glasses in the freezer so they get nice and cold. While they‚Äôre chilling, slice 4 of the 6 bananas and whiz them up in a food processor with the yoghurt, cinnamon, honey, raisins and rum until smooth. If you have time before you start blending, you can soak the raisins in the rum first to give them a chance to plump up. If not, don‚Äôt worry, you can just whiz the rum up with the rest of the ingredients for some extra flavour. (If your bananas are ripe, you won‚Äôt need quite as much honey. However, if they are still a little firm, you will need the full 3 tablespoons.)</li>
                  <li>Place the smooth banana mixture into the chilled dish from the freezer, and pop it back into the freezer alongside the serving glasses. The ice cream will need about five hours to freeze completely and will be perfect by the next evening.</li>
                  <li>On the day itself, just before you‚Äôre ready to serve the sundaes, grate the chocolate and roughly chop the hazelnuts. Toast the nuts in a dry pan for a few minutes until they are golden. Heat the dulce de leche in a small saucepan until it‚Äôs runny and, while it warms up, slice the remaining 2 bananas.</li>
                  <li>Remove the glasses from the freezer and start with a layer of the thinly sliced banana. Top with a scoop of banana ice cream, drizzle over the runny dulce de leche and finish off with the toasted hazelnuts and grated dark chocolate. Delicious!</li>

                  <li>2 tablespoons icing sugar</li>
                  <li>130 g butter</li>
                  <li>3 medium free-range egg yolks</li>
                  <li>milk</li>
                  <li>caster sugar, for sprinkling</li><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plum Filling</span><br>
                  <li>50 g flaked almonds</li>
                  <li>10 plums (1.3kg)</li>
                  <li>50 g butter</li>
                  <li>100 g caster sugar</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                  <li>¬Ω teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                  <li>3 tablespoons cornflour</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>Sift the flour, icing sugar and a pinch of sea salt into the bowl of a food processor.</li>
                  <li>Cube and add the butter, then blitz until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
                  <li>Tip in 2 egg yolks along with 60ml of ice-cold water and gradually pulse the mixture until you have a rough dough.</li>
                  <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and gently knead it for about 30 seconds, until smooth, adding a little extra flour if needed.</li>
                  <li>Divide it into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other, then roll them out into discs. Wrap both in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Roll out the larger piece of pastry and press into a 23cm pie tin. Trim it so you have 2.5cm overhang and chill it in the fridge until required. Roll out the remaining disc and cut out eight long, even strips, each about 2.5cm wide.</li>
                  <li>For the filling, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until golden. Halve and destone the plums, quartering any larger ones. Cube the butter, then place all the ingredients in a large bowl and stir well (depending on how sweet the fruit is, you may wish to add a little extra sugar).</li>
                  <li>To assemble, pile the fruit mixture into the pie base. Beat the remaining egg yolk with a splash of milk, then use it to brush the edges of the pastry.</li>
                  <li>Arrange and weave the pastry strips in a lattice pattern on top of the pie. Bring the overhanging pastry from the pie base up and over the ends of the pastry strips, pressing down to seal, then crimp it all the way around with your fingers and thumb.</li>
                  <li>Brush the pie all over with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Pop it in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Preheat the oven to 200¬∫C/gas 6 and place a baking tray inside to warm up.</li>
                  <li>Transfer the pie to the baking tray and bake it in the oven for 20 minutes, checking occasionally and rotating it if it‚Äôs colouring unevenly.</li>
                  <li>Reduce the oven to 180¬∫C/gas 4 and bake for a further 20 to 30 minutes, covering with a tent of tin foil if it‚Äôs browning too quickly.</li>
                  <li>Remove the pie from the oven, sprinkle with extra sugar and leave to set for at least 3 hours before serving.</li>
                  <li>Cut into slices and serve with ice cream or cr√®me fra√Æche, if you like.</li>

                  <li>250 g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
                  <li>50 g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting</li>
                  <li>125 g unsalted butter, (cold)</li>
                  <li>1 large free-range egg</li>
                  <li>1 splash of milk</li>
                  <li>olive oil, for greasing</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>You can make the pastry by hand, or in a food processor. If making it by hand, sieve the flour and icing sugar into a large mixing bowl from a height.</li>
                  <li>Chop the butter into small cubes, then gently work the it into the flour and sugar with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
                  <li>Beat the egg and add to the mix with the milk and gently work it together using your hands until you have a ball. Don‚Äôt work the pastry too much or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short.</li>
                  <li>Sprinkle some flour over the dough and a clean work surface, and pat the ball into a thick flat round. Sprinkle over a little more flour, then wrap the pastry in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Lightly oil the inside of a 25cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin.</li>
                  <li>Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then carefully roll out the pastry, turning it every so often, until you've got a circle about 0.5cm thick.</li>
                  <li> the pastry over the rolling pin, then unroll it into the tin, making sure you push it into all the sides.</li>
                  <li>Trim off any extra pastry, and use it to patch any holes, then prick the base of the case all over with a fork, cover with clingfilm, and pop it into the freezer for 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Preheat the oven to 180¬∫C/350¬∫F/gas 4.</li>
                  <li>Line the pastry case with a large piece of greaseproof paper, pushing it right into the sides.</li>
                  <li>Fill the pastry case right up to the top with uncooked rice, and bake blind for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Take the case out, carefully remove the rice (save it for baking blind another time) and greaseproof paper, and return the case to the oven to cook for a further 10 minutes, until it‚Äôs firm and almost biscuit-like. Leave to cool completely.</li>
                  <li>Finely grate most of the orange zest into a bowl and whisk with tablespoons of vanilla sugar and the cream until you get a silky mixture that forms soft peaks.</li>
                  <li>Put half the berries into another bowl and use a fork to mash them up with the remaining tablespoon of vanilla sugar. Break up the meringue nests into rough pieces.</li>
                  <li>	Gently fold the mushed-up berries, and the meringue pieces, into the cream.</li>
                  <li>Tip the cream mixture into the cooled tart case and gently shake it to help spread it out to the edges. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it out evenly, then sprinkle the remaining berries all over the top.</li>
                  <li>Finely grate over the remaining orange zest and serve right away, with a dusting of icing sugar.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high, and grease and line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin.</li>
                  <li>Roughly chop and place the marzipan and a little of the cream in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat using the paddle attachment until you have a thick paste. Gradually add the rest of the cream and continue to beat until you have a pale paste.</li>
                  <li>Add 170g of the butter and beat until completely incorporated. Next add the sugar and beat again until the mixture is pale and creamy.</li>
                  <li>Finally, separate and beat in the egg yolks one at a time (save the whites), then the vanilla extract. Finely grate in the orange zest.</li>
                  <li>Sift the self-raising flour and cornflour into a bowl, mix together, then, using a large metal spoon, gradually fold into the cake batter.</li>
                  <li>Whisk the egg whites to firm peaks, then fold into the batter with the large metal spoon, being careful not to knock out too much of the air.</li>
                  <li>Spoon the marmalade into a small pan and melt over a low heat, add a splash of water if needed to loosen, and keep warm.</li>
                  <li>Now to assemble the cake: using a ladle as your measure, spoon just enough batter into the cake tin to cover the base ‚Äì you‚Äôll probably need to fill the ladle to about two-thirds.</li>
                  <li>Use a pastry brush to spread the mixture evenly over the base of the tin, so it just covers the surface, then cook under the grill for 4 minutes, or until set and golden all over.</li>
                  <li>Ladle another thin layer of batter on top, and return to the grill. Once golden, brush a thin layer of the softened marmalade over the cake ‚Äì you want just enough for a thin glaze.</li>
                  <li>Continue layering and grilling, glazing with marmalade every second or third layer, until the batter is used up ‚Äì you should get 15 to 18 layers.</li>
                  <li>Brush the top of the cake with a good layer of marmalade, then run a knife around the outside of the cake. Leave to cool, then cover with clingfilm and chill for a few hours, or overnight, to set.</li>
                  <li>A couple of hours before you‚Äôre ready to serve, break the chocolate into pieces and melt with the remaining 50g butter in a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water. Once completely melted and glossy, stir through the rum, then set it aside for 10 minutes to cool.</li>
                  <li>Remove the cake from the tin and set it on a serving plate. Pour on the chocolate sauce and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the top, letting it drizzle down the sides.</li>
                  <li>Leave it to set slightly, then garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, before leaving it to cool completely. Serve with a big mug of tea or a festive sherry. This cake keeps really well in a tin for up to 2 days (not that it‚Äôll be around that long!).</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Preheat the oven to 150¬∞C/300¬∞F/gas 2. Put your egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk them at a medium speed until they start to form nice firm peaks.</li>
                  <li>With your mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and a pinch of sea salt. Turn the mixer up to the highest setting and whisk for 7 to 8 minutes more until the meringue is white, glossy and smooth.

                  <li>Line two baking trays with baking paper. Divide the meringue mixture evenly between them and shape each blob into a circle about 20cm in diameter.</li>
                  <li>Put both trays into the oven and bake for 1 hour until the meringues look slightly golden and are fluffy in the middle.</li>
                  <li>Halve or quarter the large strawberries and leave the smaller ones whole. Mix them with the raspberries.</li>
                  <li>Whip the cream with the sugar until it forms soft peaks, then stir in the yoghurt. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape out the seeds and fold them into the creamy mixture.</li>
                  <li>Spoon half the cream mixture on top of one of the meringue halves and smooth it out. Sprinkle half of your berries evenly around the cream mixture. Place the other meringue on top and press down gently to stick them together.</li>
                  <li>Spread the remaining cream mixture over the top layer and sprinkle the remaining berries on top. Pick a few small mint leaves, scatter over and enjoy!</li>

                  <li>Grease an 850ml pudding basin with oil and line with 2 sheets of clingfilm, letting a little bit overhang.</li>
                  <li>Remove any stalks from the berries. Hull and quarter the strawberries (if using).</li>
                  <li>Place all the berries in a large, heavy-based saucepan with the sugar, orange juice and vanilla paste (if using).</li>
                  <li>	Cook over a low heat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves and juices start bleeding from the fruit. Set aside to cool.</li>
                  <li>Remove the crusts from the bread, then spread over the jam.</li>
                  <li>Line the basin with 6 of the slices, jam-side up. Overlap slightly to ensure no gaps, and press the bread against the sides.</li>
                  <li>Spoon the cooled fruit and half its juice into the lined basin, reserving the remaining juice.</li>
                  <li>Cover the pudding with the last slice of bread, jam-side down, then pull over the overhanging clingfilm.</li>
                  <li>Place a saucer that fits inside the basin on top of the pudding, then place a weight, about 2kg, on top of it. Refrigerate overnight to soak up the juices.</li>

                  <li>¬Ω tsp cream of tartar</li>
                  <li>a few drops of pure peppermint extract</li><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Topping</span><br>
                  <li>100 g quality dark chocolate (70%)</li>
                  <li>vegetable oil</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>Beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy.</li>
                  <li>Beat the egg and whisk in half of it (you only need half) with the vanilla extract, then stir in the flour and cocoa powder until just combined.</li>
                  <li>Divide the mixture in half, shape each into balls, wrap both in clingfilm, then chill for a couple of hours until the dough has firmed up.</li>
                  <li>Preheat the oven to 180C¬∞/350¬∞F/gas 4, and grease and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper.</li>
                  <li>Dust a work surface with icing sugar and roll out 1 batch of dough to 5mm thick. Cut out rounds using a 5cm cutter (re-roll and cut any trimmings), then transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet.</li>
                  <li>Bake for 10 minutes till cooked through. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the second batch of dough.</li>
                  <li>To make the peppermint meringue filling, place the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar and 1¬Ω tablespoons of water in a large heatproof bowl. Beat with an electric whisk till fluffed up, about 1 minute. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water set over the lowest heat possible, and continue to beat at high speed for 10 to 12 minutes, until stiff peaks form. Remove from the heat, add a few drops of peppermint extract and beat for 2 more minutes, until the meringue has thickened even more.</li>
                  <li>Fit a 1cm plain nozzle to a piping bag and fill the bag with the peppermint meringue. Pipe onto the cooled biscuits in an upward spiral, working from the outside in; leave a small border around the edge ‚Äì aim for a swirl around 3-4cm tall. Place the biscuits on a tray and leave to set in the fridge while you make the chocolate topping.<li>
                  <li>Break the chocolate into pieces and put with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small heatproof bowl. Gently melt the chocolate over a pan of simmering water until completely smooth and glossy. Transfer to a small, deep bowl and leave to cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes.<li>
                  <li>To finish the teacakes, hold the chilled biscuits by the base and gently dip the meringue into the melted chocolate, swirling so it‚Äôs completely covered. Or, place the biscuits on a wire rack with greaseproof paper underneath and drizzle over the chocolate until each biscuit is covered. Chill the biscuits for a few hours until the chocolate has completely set, and serve.</li>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ingredients</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>2 ripe peaches, flat ones if you can get them</li>
                  <li>750 ml Prosecco, chilled</li>
                </ul>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>A peach Bellini is the classic Venetian cocktail, and my mate Arrigo serves loads of them in his world-famous establishment, Harry‚Äôs Bar. Arrigo‚Äôs grandad, Giuseppe Cipriani, opened Harry‚Äôs in 1931, and because he was a bit of a genius, he ended up inventing not only this beautiful cocktail but also another thing I absolutely love ‚Äî carpaccio. The story goes that when Giuseppe first made this cocktail the sun was setting and the colours in the drink were the same as the colours in his favourite Bellini painting‚Ä¶you can work out the rest! You can also get nice results using tinned peaches if you can't find beautifully ripe flat peaches.</li>
                  <li>I think this is best made just before serving, in front of your friends. Halve your peaches, remove their stones, then pop them into a liquidizer and blitz until smooth. Add a splash of water if needed and put the pur√©e into a jug. If you don't have a liquidizer just use your hands to squeeze, mash and really push the peaches through a sieve so you get as much as possible of their wonderful flavour and the colour from their skins into the pur√©e. You can get the pur√©e as fine as you like, but I don't mind the thickness‚Ä¶it's quite rustic. Discard (or eat!) whatever is left behind in the sieve, then pour your Prosecco into the jug and gently mix together. Divide between six glasses right away, and top up with a little more Prosecco if need be, and enjoy!</li>
                  <li>PS The spirit of the Bellini isn't exclusive to peaches ‚Äî nectarines or berries are also lovely used in the same way. There could easily be a Bellini for every month of the year.</li>
